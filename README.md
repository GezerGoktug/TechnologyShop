# Technology Shop üì±

**<p>In this project, I created an e-commerce site with HTML, CSS and Javascript. In addition to adding and removing products to the cart, which are the basic requirements of an e-commerce site, authentication and dashboard operations were also added to the project. In addition, the project was done in accordance with SEO.Users must register to the system to add products to the cart. This information is kept and does not disappear, so the user can log in again later.Features of the Project:</p>**

<strong>
<ul>
<li>Adding and deleting products to the cart</li>
<li>User authentication operations</li>
<li>Adding, deleting and updating products, updating, deleting and adding user information, adding and deleting products to featured products in the admin panel.</li>
<li>By keeping the data in the background, each user's information basket is not lost even if the site is exited. Their transactions are not lost in the updates made by the admin.</li>
<li>Reach the type of product you want by selecting the product type from the filter tags. Or if you are looking for something more specific, you can type the item you are looking for in the search bar.</li>
  
</ul>

### NOTE: To access the admin panel, you can enter admin@gmail.com as the email and admin1234 as the password.
### NOTE: To add a product from the admin panel, either get an image URL (if you are entering from a live project) or if you have downloaded the project, you can add a product by adding the .png file to the cardImages folder.
